          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, professionals are constantly seeking ways to stay competitive and relevant. SAP certifications have long been considered a valuable credential in the enterprise software space. But with the rise of cloud technologies, AI, and new business models, many are asking: Is the SAP certification still a worthwhile investment for your career?

          <h2>Context and Background</h2>
          <p>
            SAP certifications validate expertise in various areas such as SAP S/4HANA applications, SAP Business Technology Platform, SAP SuccessFactors or SAP Security. Traditionally, these certifications have opened doors to roles in consulting, implementation, and support across industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the tech ecosystem is shifting. Cloud-native platforms, low-code/no-code solutions, and integrated AI tools are changing how businesses operate. SAP itself is evolving, with a strong push toward cloud-based solutions and intelligent enterprise frameworks. This transformation raises questions about the relevance of traditional SAP certifications in today’s job market and also, how does the certification stay up-to-date?

          <h2>1. Industry Demand and Job Market Trends</h2>
          <p>
            SAP remains deeply embedded in many large organizations. Roles requiring SAP expertise—especially in finance, supply chain, and HR—are still in demand. Certifications can help candidates stand out, particularly in competitive markets or when transitioning into SAP-related roles.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, employers increasingly value hands-on experience with newer SAP technologies, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Fiori, and integration with third-party platforms. Certifications that reflect these modern capabilities are more relevant than legacy ones.

            We also found an interesting visual where SAP says that 73% of job candidates received or anticipated salary increase due to the certification. <em>(SAP Certification Infographic)</em>

          <h2>2. SAP’s Own Evolution</h2>
          <p>
            SAP has updated its certification programs to align with its cloud-first strategy. Currently old certifications are retiring at a fast pace, and the new certifications emphasize the cloud-based tools. The SAP Learning Hub and SAP Certification Hub now offer more dynamic, role-based learning paths. Continuous learning and re-certification are encouraged to keep pace with product updates and innovations. Periodic recertification is at the moment required yearly.

          <h2>3. Career Path Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            For consultants, developers, and analysts working in SAP environments, certification remains a strong asset. It demonstrates commitment, foundational knowledge, and credibility. For those in leadership or strategic roles, however, broader business acumen and cross-platform integration skills may carry more weight than technical certifications alone.
