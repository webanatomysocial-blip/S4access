          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            As we step into autumn 2025, the European business landscape is undergoing a significant transformation. Economic pressures, shifting market dynamics, and geopolitical uncertainties are reshaping how organizations operate. One clear trend is emerging: companies are becoming increasingly cost-conscious, and the demand for delivering more value with the same—or even reduced—budgets is stronger than ever.

          <h2>Context and Background</h2>
          <p>
            This new market reality is affecting organizations in very different ways. Some are accelerating digital transformation to stay competitive, while others are tightening operations to preserve margins. Regardless of the strategy, one area remains non-negotiable: SAP security and access management.

          <h2>1. What We're Seeing in the Field</h2>
          <p>
            From our work, several patterns are becoming clear:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Access management often lacks planning.</strong> Many organizations still operate without a clear specific plan for SAP Access management, leading to inefficiencies and increased risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Reactive firefighting is common.</strong> Teams frequently respond to issues in isolation—audit findings, user complaints—without addressing root causes.</li>
            <li><strong>Tool-centric approaches fall short.</strong> Technology alone isn’t enough. Without the plan, tools are underused and misaligned with business needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Competence gaps are widening.</strong> The need for SAP access management expertise is growing, but skilled professionals are hard to find and retain.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. Is There a Way Forward?</h2>
          <p>
            Easier said than done? Absolutely. Saving and improving at the same time can feel like a contradiction—but we believe there’s always a way to do things better.
          </p>
          <p>
            At s4access, we’ve gathered a lot of insights on how to develop a new approach and move forward successfully. The method is straightforward:
          </p>

            <li>Understand where you are—get a clear picture of your current access management setup.</li>
            <li>Create a plan—define your goals and the steps to reach them.</li>
            <li>Decide what matters most—prioritize based on impact and urgency.</li>
            <li>Start executing—progress begins with action, even small steps.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h2>Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>SAP security and access management remain critical in the face of economic and market challenges.</li>
            <li>Lack of planning and reactive approaches increase risks and inefficiencies in SAP access management.</li>
            <li>A structured, proactive approach—assessing, planning, prioritizing, and executing—can align SAP security with business needs.</li>
            <li>Addressing competence gaps and leveraging expertise are essential for long-term success.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
