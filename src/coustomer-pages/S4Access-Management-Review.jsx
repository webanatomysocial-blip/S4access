                        The customer had initiated an SAP S/4 implementation project in collaboration with a large international service integrator. During the process, an external audit uncovered fundamental issues in SAP access management, raising concerns at the top management level. To address these concerns and gain a clearer understanding of the situationâ€™s severity, the customer engaged s4access, a specialist firm, to conduct a targeted review and identify actionable solutions.
